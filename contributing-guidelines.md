# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! I welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your time and effort.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy of the project
2. **Clone your fork** - Download your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** - Make a new branch for your changes
4. **Make your changes** - Implement your feature or fix
5. **Test your changes** - Ensure everything works as expected
6. **Submit a pull request** - Open a PR against the main branch

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate of others. I expect all contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the project and community

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Your environment details (OS, version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please open an issue with:

- A clear description of the feature

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Ensure your code follows the project's coding style
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Make sure all tests pass
5. Keep commits atomic and write clear commit messages

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
- **Write descriptive titles** - Summarize what the PR does
- **Include context** - Explain why the change is needed
- **Reference issues** - Link to related issues if applicable
- **Be patient** - Reviews may take some time

## Development Setup

Check the project's `README.md` for specific setup instructions. Generally:

1. Install dependencies

3. Make your changes
4. Run tests again before submitting

# Security Policy

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects, please report it responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the repository owner. You can find contact information on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/martoc).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

## What to Expect

After you submit a report:

1. **Acknowledgment** - I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment** - I will investigate and assess the severity of the issue
3. **Updates** - I will keep you informed of progress toward resolution
4. **Resolution** - Once fixed, I will notify you and credit you (if desired)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- This blog (martoc.github.io)
- All public repositories under [github.com/martoc](https://github.com/martoc)

## Responsible Disclosure

I kindly ask that you:

- Give me reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying data that does not belong to you
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations and service disruption

## Recognition

I appreciate the security research community's efforts in helping keep projects secure. Contributors who report valid vulnerabilities responsibly may be acknowledged in the project (with their permission).

# Abstract

My job has been converting technical requirements of a project into
the architecture and design that will guide the final product. For many years,
I've been creating fault-tolerant and highly available cloud solutions that are
deployed worldwide and are managed by very small teams. I'm sharing my
experiences and some of the solutions that I have designed and implemented.

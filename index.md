# Abstract

For many years, I've been creating fault-tolerant and highly available cloud
solutions that are deployed worldwide and are managed by very small teams. I'm
sharing my experiences and the deployed solutions that I have designed and
implemented. My job has been converting technical requirements of a project into
the architecture and design that will guide the final product.

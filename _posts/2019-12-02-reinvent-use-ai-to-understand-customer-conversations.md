I attended this workshop today, I learnt that AWS provides a full stack of
services that can help you to integrate your call centre calls or even create
your own call centre and from the recording from these sources you can get real
information about these conversations, Amazon Connect, Transcribe, Comprehend,
Athena and QuickSight were some of the main services I used in this workshop.

In this example, I created the call centre using Amazon Connect, the following
diagram shows the main components and how these interact with each other.

With NAT Gateway this looks like something of the past, but recently I had to
configure a NAT instance in our deployment. This Cloudformation configuration
creates an Autoscaling group of 1 (it's fault-tolerant and no highly available),
when the instance is created the user data section hooks an EIP.

# Deployment

Increase your impact with self-service infrastructure templates and provisioning automation.

Amplify platform engineering impact by implementing scalable self-service capabilities for developers.

Empower developers to move faster with a self-service tool to provision infrastructure and manage code deployment always aligned with your governance, security and best practices.

Accelerate adoption of GitOps best practices within your team.


Implement self-service infrastructure portals: Speed up the software development lifecycle with pre-approved templates for infrastructure.
Accelerate modern application deployments: Support reliable deployments for modern applications with consistent standards for CI/CD, security, and monitoring.
Track versions and updates in a centralized solution: View and manage templates, and the versions used for your infrastructure in one place.
Empower developers with flexibility: Use components to allow app developers to customize infrastructure resources.

# Features

It helps platform and DevOps engineers scale their impact by defining and updating infrastructure for self-service deployments. Users create standard, vetted templates that become the basis for turnkey use by developers in order to meet security, cost, and compliance goals.

Maintaining hundreds or thousands of microservices with continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) configurations is a challenging task for even the most capable platform teams. It helps platform team manage this complexity with a deployment workflow tool optimized to support the full software development lifecycle of modern applications.

Developers can use it as a self-service interface to provision infrastructure and deploy their projects without interacting with the underlying resources. It provides visibility into the general status of your application, including stacks in use and stack health status. You have access to the CI/CD pipeline, observability tools, and source control for each one.

## Customer-managed environments

You can bring your existing shared resources like an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Developers can then deploy to any environment.

## Multi-account support

It supports multi-account infrastructures, which help platform operators configure their architecture securely across multiple AWS accounts.

## Streamlined upgrades

It supports versioning of infrastructure templates and provides developers with updates for out-of-date deployments.

## Template management

Platform engineers can use it to create a stack that is stored and managed in Git as a reusable version-controlled template. These stacks are defined using infrastructure as code in a simple, declarative style with everything needed to provision, deploy, and manage a service including compute, networking, code pipeline, security, and monitoring resources. Platform engineers create stacks for environments and services, and typically deploy environments. Then, developers can self-serve to deploy service infrastructure required for their applications.
